## Smart Contract Implementation

### Token Smart Contract

- **Features**:
  - **Burnable**: Implementation of the `burn()` function to destroy tokens.
  - **Access Control**: Use of a role pattern to differentiate operational capabilities within the contract.
  - **Pausable**: Inclusion of a pause mechanism to stop operations in case of emergencies.
  - **Blacklisting**: Ability to exclude specific addresses from operating with the tokens.
- **Upgradeability**: Adoption of the UUPS pattern for potential future updates to the contract.

## Revenue Sharing and Buyback System

The buyback system includes:

- **Revenue Sharing**: A percentage of revenues is used to buy tokens from the market and redistribute them.
- **Buyback and Burn**: Periodically, tokens are bought back and burned to reduce the supply and potentially influence the token price.

### Notes on Buyback

The functions for calculating revenues will not be directly part of the smart contracts but managed by external systems, to ensure flexibility and security in revenue sharing and buyback operations.
